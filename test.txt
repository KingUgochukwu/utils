Predictive Services Discussion: Elevated to critical conditions are expected over much of the Southwest into 
west Texas and the southern Front Range of Colorado where west winds of 15-25 mph with gusts 30-40 mph 
will coincide with afternoon relative humidity of 3-15%. Downslope west winds are also forecast across the High 
Plains  of  eastern  Wyoming  into  South  Dakota  and  Nebraska with  gusts to 45  mph  possible. Dry  and  breezy 
conditions are expected across the western Florida peninsula as well. Showers and thunderstorms will develop 
across the central and northern Mississippi Valley with severe thunderstorms possible over eastern Oklahoma 
into the Ozarks. A deep Pacific trough will begin to move into the West Coast with heavy rain along the northern 
California and Northwest coasts and snow for the Cascades and northern Sierra.

Leadership Environment 
Leadership Category 
 
Leadership is the act of influencing people to achieve a result. The leadership environment is 
made up of critical elements that a successful leader must consider in planning for effective 
action. Those critical elements are: 
 
 You – the leader, who is ultimately responsible for all action and results. 
 Your people – those who you are responsible for. 
 Situation – comprised of the many unique variables that influence a leader’s 
decision such as objectives, conditions, resources available, organizational 
influences, and others affected by the action. 
 Consequences – the short- and long-term effects of your actions. 
Leaders constantly assess the elements of the leadership environment and adapt accordingly. 
Successful leaders understand the interplay of these variables and demonstrate flexibility in 
selecting appropriate leadership tools and techniques as situations change.
